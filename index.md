# Al-Ehsaan - Muslim Support Network of New England

## Background
Alhamdulillah, in a brainstorming session 20 concerned Muslim seniors and adults discussed unfavorable situations which are faced by Muslim seniors living in the New England Area. It may be more or less similar in all over the USA. The meeting concluded that we must act now to address the issues and follow a path of gradual development taking one thing at a time.

_Al Ehsaan Muslim Support Network of New England_ is a modest beginning with the hope and motivation to become a multifaceted organization covering many areas of needs of Muslims in the community, in sha Allah.

## Moto - Know Us Before You Need Us
Our motto is to support the seniors and disadvantaged Muslim brothers and sisters living in New England. Working with them and our caretakers (children or relatives) we strive to find the best solutions for the needs they face. We serve through local communities working with us.
