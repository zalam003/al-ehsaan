## Background
Alhamdulillah, in a brainstorming session 20 concerned Muslim seniors and adults discussed unfavorable situations which are faced by Muslim seniors living in the New England Area. It may be more or less similar in all over the USA. The meeting concluded that we must act now to address the issues and follow a path of gradual development taking one thing at a time.

The Al Ehsan: Muslim Support Network is a modest beginning with the hope and motivation to become a multifaceted organization covering many areas of needs of Muslims in the community, in sha Allah.
