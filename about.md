Alhamdulillah, in a brainstorming session 20 concerned Muslim citizens discussed the unfavorable situations faced by senior Muslims living in the New England Area. The situation may be more or less similar in other parts of the USA. The meeting concluded that we must act now to address issues faced by all Muslims and follow a path to gradual development programs to take care of one another. The programs will be identified and acted upon one at a time.

The Al Ehsaan Muslim Support Network was born to be a catelyst organization to bring the Muslim community together.
